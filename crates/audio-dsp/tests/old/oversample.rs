//! Vendored copy of the pre-#224 true-peak polyphase interpolator, kept only so
//! `tests/resample_equiv.rs` can run old against new.
//!
//! Source: storytold/filmcraft `crates/audio-dsp/src/oversample.rs` at 7322aad (origin/main before
//! cloudbring/artcraft-algorithms#224), everything above its `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`.
//! Additions, all at the end: `phases` (all `factor` outputs of `push_peak`, same dot product) and
//! `push_peak_sequential` (the sequential-sum reference that file's own test carried, here as a
//! method). Clippy allows and rustfmt only otherwise.
